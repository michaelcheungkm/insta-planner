## Getting started

Make sure you have Node.js and Npm installed, then open your terminal.  
Run this command to generate a **dxlliv/planner** instance from scratch:

```bash
npx create-plxnner planner
```
[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/dxlliv/planner?file=src%2Fpublic%2Fuser%2Finstagram%2Fdxlliv%2Fconfig.json)

### Configuration

You can make changes to your profile by editing `src/public/user/instagram/{username}`.  
Update `planner.config.ts` accordingly. Read the [documentation](https://dxlliv.github.io/planner/docs/) for further information.

### Interactive Planning via UI

You might also like to directly edit your profile using a simple user interface.  
In that case, just upload the media and rearrange your grid as desired.

Export your changes in zip format and overwrite your profile configuration.  
*I may release a Node.js helper in the future, to speed up this process.*

## Development

I'd like to make this tool accessible to all the people directly from the browser with an intuitive interface, without installing any software or changing a single line of code. Some changes have already been made.

If you want to contribute and improve **dxlliv/planner**,  
clone the repository and move to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dxlliv/planner.git && cd planner
```

Install dependencies and run the project in development mode:

```bash
yarn install && yarn dev

# or use npm
npm install && npm run dev
```
